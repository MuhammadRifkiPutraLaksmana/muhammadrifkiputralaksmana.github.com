                        SKY Racing Team VR46 unveil their 2021 liveries
                    </div>

                    <p>SKY Racing Team VR46 has unveiled their liveries for the 2021 season, including the first-ever VR46 sponsored MotoGP™ machine. Luca Marini, Marco Bezzecchi and Celestino Vietti were all present for the launch from the VR46 Riders Academy headquarters in Tavullia, with it broadcast live on Sky Uno in Italy ahead of the X Factor final. </p>
                    <p>35-year old Pedrosa joined the KTM team upon his retirement in 2018 and as one of the most decorated MotoGP racers of the modern era. The Spaniard brought 13 years of top-flight experience in the premier class to the KTM MotoGP project. The work of both Kallio and Pedrosa and the testing squad helped KTM to win three Grands Prix with two different riders in 2020 and register eight podium finishes thanks to the advancement and potential of the KTM RC16.</p>
                    <p>The new MotoGP™ and Moto2™ liveries for the 2021 season, put together by the VR46 creative department, have the same look for both classes: a touch of satin grey becomes shiny black, with a play of contrasts introduced by the chrome blue, which redesigns the graphics of the two teams in a more racing way.</p>
                    <p>A blockbuster 2020 saw the Italian outfit secure the Moto2™ Team World title, second in the Moto2™ World Championship thanks to Luca Marini's efforts, plus 17 podiums and 7 victories across the lightweight and intermediate classes. Born in 2014 when VR46 and Sky came together to support the growth of Italian talent throughout MotoGP™, they will make their first leap into the premier class in 2021 with Luca Marini after an agreement was reached between SKY Racing Team VR46, Esponsorma Racing and Ducati.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, Marco Bezzecchi will remain in Moto2™ and look to clinch the squad's second intermediate class crown following Francesco Bagnaia's success in 2018. The curly-haired Italian will be joined there by Celestino Vietti, who makes the jump up from the Moto3™ class after two successful seasons. </p>
                    <p>In both classes, the SKY Racing Team VR46 will be able to count on the commitment and trust of partners who have embraced the team's philosophy over the past few years. WITH U, Monster Energy and Bardahl will continue to be the main partners of the project. Fassi is also confirmed together with Dainese and AGV, alongside the team since its birth.</p>
